# FPDS Simulator

This is a simulation of the implementation of Fixed Priority Deferred Preemption Scheduler which uses the FNR-PA algorithm as proposed by [Davis et al](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6424789).

To replicate the results, simply run `script.sh`.

## Requirements
- GCC to compile the CPP file.
- The python libraries `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `argparse`.
